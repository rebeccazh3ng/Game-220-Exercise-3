# Game-220-Exercise-3
Creating a UI sound library

## Assignment

You are tasked with creating User Interface sounds for the menu page and inventory screen of an adventure/survival game. These sounds are _non diagetic_, but they should fit the overall theme of the game, which is "outdoor survival". The client requested that the sounds "sound organic" and "not electronic".

An asset list is provided with a list of requested sounds.


### Audio asset requirements
- **Each file must be a 24bit, 44.1kHz Stereo .wav file.**
- Each sound should be in the `sound_assets` directory on the repo
- Each filename should be human readable and use the `Asset Name` _as_ its filename:
    - For example, for an `Asset Name`: "menu-open": 
        - `menu-open.wav`
- Each file should be peak normalized to -5 dBFs
- Each file should have less than 0.25 seconds of silence at beginning
- Each file should have less than 0.25 seconds of silence at ending


### Communication
Some `Designer Notes` are included for a couple sounds. Please read these.

If needed, please leave any notes on the sounds provided in the `Sound Designer Notes` field.

Notes should be clear in meaning and directed toward the Game Designer in how to use the sound.

If you have any questions about the asset list, please open a github issue on this repo, and mention @nharsch in the comment.


## How to edit .tsv files

`.tsv` files are plain text files for tabular data. They can be opened with spreadsheet apps like Excel, Numbers, and/or Google Sheets. If you use spreadsheet apps to edit the Asset List, be sure that you Save As or Export a tsv file. 

Here's a [quick video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XbXL-ZrprCw) on how to import and export TSV files with Google Sheets.

Since TSV files are plain text, they can be edited with any text editor. Each column in a row is separated by a tab, each row separated by a line break.
